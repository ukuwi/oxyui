Editor Enhancer for Oxygen improves the user interface design by adding styles and scripts to the Oxygen editor for users who are logged in and have the editor open. 

== Description ==
Editor Enhancer for Oxygen\'s styles update or override existing styles from Oxygen for better user interface design. Scripts are used specifically for adding helpful keyboard shortcuts, updating the \"Back to WP\" drop down with additional, common admin links. These links make it easier for developers to get around the admin, and include:
 - Oxygen templates,
 - posts,
 - pages, and
 - media.

The scripts also add some much needed functionality and simplification.

Key styling features include an updated DOM tree panel (aka, the Structure panel), condensed styling inputs, and a neutral gray background.

Keyboard shortcuts - tested primarily on Windows 10 - allow for saving, duplicating selected element, quick-view full-screen, and toggling the five core panels.

A full list of features can be found at the bottom of the Editor Enhancer for Oxygen homepage, https://oxyui.ukuwi.com/.
